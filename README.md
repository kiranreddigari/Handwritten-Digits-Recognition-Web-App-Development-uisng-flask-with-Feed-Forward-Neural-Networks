For Installing Tensorflow CPU and GPU versions and other packages refer below link: 
https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-jul-2020.ipynb

For installing Keras refer below link and install it in virtual environment of tensorflow as it is said in above link https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/keras

we are creating web app for handwritten digits using Flask:
--In static folder it has javascript and css files.
--In Template folder it has html files,i stored in separate template folder it will be easy to access from flask framework.

step1:run FFNN for MNIST.ipynb it saves weights
step2:then run app.py file from command prompt ie., python app.py
--a url appears when you run it,take that url and copy it in any web browser
